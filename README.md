## Description

I was motivated to create this express server side application because it helped me strenghthen a foundation on more back end elements instead of the front-end work I am so used to. This application allows users to write and store little notes on the page. The content will even remain after users refresh the page.

## Usage

User will be prompted to get started. Afterwards, users can type in a title and description for notes. Then the user can save and add the note to a list that will be desplayed onto the page
